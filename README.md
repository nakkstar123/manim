A collection of math animations I programmed for various purposes including supplementing math-tutoring I did in high school, creating videos for DiagKNOWstics Learning during an internship and creating visual aids as assistant instructor for UCLA's math circle.

## Note

Check the "finished-product" branch to see the animations. The source code for most videos has not been provided as it was lost during data transfer between laptops.
